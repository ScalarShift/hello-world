# hello-world
My first repository

Hi. I've always had an interest in computers, and computer programming. I've learned Java and C++ to a lower-intermediate/intermediate level, and would love to continue studying them as well as other languages and programming concepts in general. I do, however, want to expand my employability and potentially dig in to some kind of development career.
